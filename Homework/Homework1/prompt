Projet 1:

The purpose of this project is to generate thirty random whole numbers between 1 and 10, insert them into a vector in descending order, then and print the numbers in ascending order:

Use the following plan of attack:

Create an empty vector of int elements.
Use the srand function to change the "seed" for generating random numbers so that the rand function will generate a different set of random numbers every time your program is run.
Use the rand function to generate a random number whole number between 0 and RAND_MAX (using Dev-C++, RAND_MAX is 32,767).
Convert this number into a number between 1 and 10.
hint: use the % operator.
Use a loop to scan the vector until you find the position of an element containing a number that is less than the random number just generated above.
Use an iterator to insert the random number into the vector at that position.
Go back to step 3 and perform again until the vector contains 30 random numbers
After all 30 numbers have been generated and inserted into the vector, they should appear in descending order in the vector.
Use the pop_back function in a loop to print the numbers in ascending order on the console until the vector is empty.

Project 2:

Below is a list of the 14 countries in South America, including their population and area:
 
Name	Population
(in 1,000's)	Area
(sq. miles)
  Argentina	45,258  	1,073,234  
  Bolivia	11,696  	424,052  
  Brazil	212,845  	3,287,086  
  Chile	19,206  	291,855  
  Columbia	51,115  	440,715  
  Ecuador	17,705  	106,851  
  Falkland Islands	3  	4,700  
  French Guiana	290  	32,253  
  Guyana	787  	82,978  
  Paraguay	7,145  	157,056  
  Peru	33,108  	496,093  
  Suriname	586  	63,252  
  Uruguay	3,475  	68,037  
  Venezuela	28,102  	353,748  
 
Create a class called Country.

The properties (variables) of each country will be its name, population, and area.
Put the definitions of those properties and prototypes of functions in a header file with a guard.
Put the function definitions in a .cpp file.
Functions should include a constructor and "getters" for each property of the class.
Then, similar to what you did in project 1:

Create an empty vector of Country elements (make this a global variable).
In main, in alphabetic order, create a Country object for each of the countries in South America.
as each is created insert it into the vector in ascending order based on the country's area.
consider writing a function which takes a Country object and inserts it into the vector in the appropriate spot in the vector.
Once the vector is filled, print a report showing each country.
At the top of the report, put headings at the top of each column.
Do not use pop_back.   Instead, simply use a loop to access and print the values of each country in the vector, starting with element #0.
Inside the loop, use the cout object to align columns:
The name of the country should be left-aligned (padded to the right)
The population and area should be right-aligned (padded to the left)
The first part of your report might look like the following:
       Country      Population     Area
  ----------------  ----------  ----------  
  Falkland Islands           3        4700
  French Guiana            290       32253
  Suriname                 586       63252
  Uruguay                 3475       68037
  Guyana                   787       82978
  Ecuador                17705      106851
               . . . . . . . .
After all countries have been printed, show totals for the population and area columns.
